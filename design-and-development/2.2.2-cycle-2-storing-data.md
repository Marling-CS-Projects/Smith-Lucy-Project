# 2.2.2 Cycle 2: Storing Data

## Design

In the previous cycle, I produced a program that was able to collect data from sensors and upload these values to the particle cloud. In this section, I will now focus on how this data can be processed and stored, to make it accessible to my weather application.

In this cycle I aim to learn how to use a text-based database (MongoDB). I will then produce a program that uploads readings from the weather station to the database so that it can be accessed in later cycles.

### Objectives

* [ ] Learn how to use MongoDB
* [ ] Design a program that uploads data to MongoDB
* [ ] Use database to record data from the weather station
* [ ] Data processing

### Usability Features

Ensuring that this database works correctly is vital to my project because it will allow my app to connect to the weather station and show trends in the environment over time. The program should automatically upload and store data without any input from the user. To improve usability for the stakeholder, the data recorded on MongoDB must be accurate and valid, to prevent any incorrect data trends or problems in later development cycles.

### Tests I need to conduct

| ID  | Test                                       | Description                                                                                                                                    | Pass Criteria |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 2.1 | Design basic program to setup the database | In this test, I will learn how to interact with mongoDB                                                                                        |               |
| 2.2 | Upload data to database                    | I will simulate the types of data that will need to be recorded by the weather station and ensure it is stored correctly                       |               |
| 2.3 | Setup database with weather station        | In this section, I will use the data from my weather station program and upload it to the MongoDB                                              |               |
| 2.4 | Data processing and validation             | I will adapt the program to ensure that data from the weather station is recorded at regular intervals, and only valid/accurate data is stored |               |
| 2.5 | Retrieving data from database              | In this test, I will setup a program that interacts with MongoDB and retrieves data, ready for later development cycles                        |               |
