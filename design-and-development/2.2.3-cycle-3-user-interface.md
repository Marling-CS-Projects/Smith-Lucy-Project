# 2.2.3 Cycle 3: User Interface

## Design

Now that I have programed the foundations of my solution, data collection and storage, in this cycle I will begin developing the user interface for my weather monitoring application. Once this stage is complete, I will then be able to move on to displaying the data I have collected, monitoring trends over time, and weather prediction.

In this cycle I will design and develop a basic web app that is capable of displaying weather data.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [ ] Setup a basic web app using
* [ ] Add content to web app
* [ ] Format web app
* [ ] Improve usability and test

### Usability Features

In order to meet the needs of the stakeholder, the user interface for my weather app needs to provide the best user experience possible. It must be easy to use and navigate, and should require a minimal input from the user to work correctly. It must be effective at visually presenting any weather data the user wants to access, and must also be able to connect to mongoDB to display data.

### Tests I need to conduct

Although I am eventually going to need to incoperate live  data collected from my weather station and documents stored in my database, in this cycle I am going to focus on building a basic user interface that meets the usability requirements of a stakeholder.
