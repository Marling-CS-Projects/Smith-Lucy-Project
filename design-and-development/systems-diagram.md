This diagram shows the different parts of the weather monitoring and prediction system that I will be focusing on. I have split each section into smaller sub-sections, using [computional methods ](../analysis/1.4b-computational-methods.md)such as decomposition. Throughout the development stage, I will pick one or two of these sections to focus on at a time to gradually build up and piece the personal weather station together. Blue sections represent features that I must include for my solution to be functional, while the purple section includes features that a stakeholder may want to include but are not essential to completing the project. Each of these components corresponds roughly to the [sucess criteria](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

## Usability Features

Usability features will ensure that any stakeholder is able to use the weather monitoring and prediction system. Therefore, I will use the following key points to make my project accessible and provide the best user experience. I will make my solution effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant and easy to learn. These criteria will help me design a program that is usable by a stakeholder.

### Effective

I need to make sure that all processes carried out by the personal weather system are effective and are carried out automatically. This means a stakeholder will be able to use my solution efficiently without any additional input. The personal weather station must be able to take readings from the outdoor environment and transmit data to the internet to be recorded on a database. The accompanying app must then be able to pull this data and display it in a way that can be used effectively by a stakeholder.

As well as the weather station communicating with the app, communication between the app and stakeholder must be effective to ensure they get the best possible user experience. I will use tables and graphs to present data so that it can be easily understood. The ways I aim to make my project effective are shown below.

#### Aims

* The personal weather station will need to automatically take readings from the environment at regular intervals&#x20;
* It must then be able to communicate with the app wirelessly without input from the user
* The user interface will then need to display weather monitoring and forecasting information visually

### Efficiency

Making my project efficient involves making the weather station easy to set up and use so that the stakeholder can quickly monitor their outdoor environment. The app must be easy to navigate and connect to the weather station, and then be updated automatically with accurate weather information. To simplify the setting up process, the user should only have to follow basic instructions before setting up the device. Once this is done, they should quickly start recieving usable weather data from the app.

All previous measurements must be recorded so that trends tracked by the user. This will also allow the device to detect sudden changes in weather conditions. Another important feature of my solution is therefore how data is stored. Previous weather information should be recorded on a online database, so that it can be quickly and efficiently accessed by a user upon request.

#### Aims

* It should be easy to set up the app and connect to the weather station
* A stakeholder should be able to navigate through the app easily and understand all displayed data
* All previous data readings should be uploaded to a database so that they can be easily accessed by the user at a later date

### Engaging

Making the solution for the user will ensure that the device is interesting and easy to use. While the main purpose of this project is to provide a stakeholder usable information about their local environment, my solution must still be engaging and interesting to use. I must also ensure my solution preferable to other traditional weather applications. To achive this, I will try to make the app as engaging as possible. I will give the app a colourful design, and use tables and graphs to display weather data in an interesting way. By carefully considering the design of the weather station, I will be able grab the attention of the user so that they can make the best use of the personal weather station's features.

#### Aims

* Design an app that is colourful and easy to navigate
* Present all weather data in the form of graphs and tables to grab the attention of the user

### Error Tolerant

In order to ensure my solution is error tolerant, I need to program the app to be able to deal with any errors or bugs in data. Errors that could occur include difficulties connecting the weather station and pulling data from the database. Additionally, my solution will have to deal with incorrect or damaged data and not include it in processing. I will also need to test both the weather station and the app thoroughly to ensure both work together correctly.

#### Aims

* The app should be able to communicate with the weather station and database
* Any anomalous or incorrect data should not be displayed on the weather app&#x20;

### Easy To Learn

To ensure that my weather monitoring system isn't to complicated for a stakeholder to use, I need to simplify the setting up process as much as possible. On the app I will need to include a section that explains how to set up and use the weather station, and how to connect it to the internet. From there, the app must be straight forward to use and shouldn't require much additional guidence. The stakeholder should start recieving inputs from their outdoor environment on the app and easily understand the data being presented.

#### Aims

* Create a section that explains how to set up the weather station on the app
* Include a tutorial explaining what the features of the app itself are and how to use them
* All other processes should take place automatically and therefore not require any user input
