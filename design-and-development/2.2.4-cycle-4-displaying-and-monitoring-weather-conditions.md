# 2.2.4 Cycle 4: Displaying and Monitoring Weather Conditions

## Design

In previous sections, I have designed a weather station to take readings from the environment, which then uploads to a database. These weather readings are then accessed by a user interface, which are displayed in the history section of the app.&#x20;

In this cycle, I am going to use this data to monitor weather conditions. The app will display current weather conditions, including temperature, pressure and humidity. Data can also be used to show the trends in conditions, in the form of a graph.

### Objectives

* [ ] Display current readings for weather conditions on the user interface
* [ ] Monitor weather conditions over time in the form of graphs
* [ ] Display other basic information on the user interface
* [ ] Complete settings and about section of user interface

### Usability Features

I need to ensure that any data displayed visually on my user interface is effective and engaging. Data must be presented in a way that is meaningful to the user, such as graphs and tables. The user interface will also need to be error tolerant, and be able to deal with missing data readings.

### Tests I need to conduct

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 4.1 | Display the most recent readings stored in the database on the user interface.                                                                           |             |               |
| 4.2 | Display current readings for all the data collected by the weather station, such as temperature, pressure and air quality.                               |             |               |
| 4.3 | Visually display trends in data, e.g. graphs and tables.                                                                                                 |             |               |
| 4.4 | Display any other basic information, such as the time since the last reading and the time the weather station was first activated on the user interface. |             |               |
| 4.5 | Settings options                                                                                                                                         |             |               |

## Data structures

| Structure Name | Structure Type | Description |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
|                |                |             |
|                |                |             |
|                |                |             |

## Development

### 4.1

Firstly, in this part of the cycle I am going to design a program that displays the most recent weather readings stored on the database.

### 4.2

Having displayed the values for the most recent readings on the user interface, I am now going to focus on each reading individually, making sure it is updated with additional readings

### 4.3

Previously, I have designed a program that displays current readings on the user interface. In this section, I am going to visually show the trends in weather data, allowing the user to monitor their environment more closely.&#x20;

### 4.4

In this section, I am going to improve the functionality of the user interface by displaying basic infomation about the data, such as when it was last updated.

### 4.5

Finally, I am going to focus on the settings section of my user interface.

### Testing

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happened | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
|      |              |               |                        |           |
