# 2.2.1 Cycle 1: Data Collection

## Design

In this first cycle, I have decided to use the Particle Argon (a Wi-Fi enabled development board) to program data collection for my personal weather station. I will use Visual Studio Code as an IDE and the Particle Workbench extension to create my project.&#x20;

I aim to learn how the Particle Argon communicates with and takes readings from sensors to take measurements from the environment. This will include measurments of pressure, humidity, temperature and air quality. Once I have tested how these different sensors work individually, I will design a program that takes readings from these sensors simultaneously.

### Objectives

* [ ] Set up basic project with Particle Argon
* [ ] Design a program that communicates with sensors using C++
