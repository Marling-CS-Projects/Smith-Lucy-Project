# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

Throughout this section, I am going to go through a series of tests from [Cycles 1-6](../design-and-development/cycle-1.md) to ensure that they work correctly on the system as a whole.&#x20;

## Cycle 1 - Data Collection

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                                           | What I expect                                                                               | What actually happens                                                                                                           | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Compile and flash weather station code to Particle Argon device        | Code should compile and flash without errors. Device should then reconnect to the internet. | When the weather station program is run on the device, it runs without errors. The device connects to the internet as expected. | Pass      |
| 2    | The program should collect readings from the barometer sensor (BME280) | Data collected should be displayed in serial monitor/ particle console variables.           | As expected, readings for temperature, pressure, humidity and altitude are still recieved by the particle cloud.                | Pass      |
| 3    | Implement other sensors into the program                               | Collect readings for air quality, dust levels, light and sound.                             | Readings for air quality, dust levels, light and sound are taken by the weather station.                                        | Pass      |
| 4    | Check that the values measured on sensors are correct                  | Data readings that are close to the manually measured value.                                | I found that all manually measured readings for weather conditions matched results from the weather station.                    | Pass      |
