# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

Throughout this section, I am going to go through a series of tests from [Cycles 1-6](../design-and-development/cycle-1.md) to ensure that they work correctly on the system as a whole.&#x20;

## Cycle 1 - Data Collection

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                                           | What I expect                                                                               | What actually happens                                                                                                           | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Compile and flash weather station code to Particle Argon device        | Code should compile and flash without errors. Device should then reconnect to the internet. | When the weather station program is run on the device, it runs without errors. The device connects to the internet as expected. | Pass      |
| 2    | The program should collect readings from the barometer sensor (BME280) | Data collected should be displayed in serial monitor/ particle console variables.           | As expected, readings for temperature, pressure, humidity and altitude are still received by the particle cloud.                | Pass      |
| 3    | Implement other sensors into the program                               | Collect readings for air quality, dust levels, light and sound.                             | Readings for air quality, dust levels, light and sound are taken by the weather station.                                        | Pass      |
| 4    | Check that the values measured on sensors are correct                  | Data readings that are close to the manually measured value.                                | I found that all manually measured readings for weather conditions matched results from the weather station.                    | Pass      |

### Evidence

The compiled weather station program still runs correctly on the particle argon device without error. The device is able to connect to the internet, and publish data for temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude, air quality, dust concentration, light and sound on the particle console.

I then compared the readings with manually measured values, and I found that the readings still had a high level of accuracy. For instance, I compared light in bright and dark rooms, sound in quiet and loud environments, and compared the recorded temperature (22) with the manually measured temperature (21.7).

## Cycle 2 - Storing Data

### Tests

| 2    | Python program uploads weather data to MongoDB | The python program should connect to mongo database and carry out some basic operations, including inserting, updating and deleting data.                                                           | While the overall system has no need to delete any data stored on the database, it is able to insert and update data. | Pass      |
| 3    | Connect the python program the the MQTT client | For this test, I expect the python program to receive weather data and then print it in the terminal. It should then make any necessary alterations (e.g. adding a date and timestamp to the data). | Data was retrieved from MQTT broker and a timestamp was added, and printed in the terminal.                           | Pass      |
| 4    | Upload weather data to database                | The next test is to ensure the weather data is stored on mongoDB in the correct format.                                                                                                             | All data types were correct on the database.                                                                          | Pass      |

### Evidence
