# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

Testing the usability of my weather station will allow me to understand how my solution is able to fit the needs of the stakeholder. To do this, I will test whether my solution is effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant, and easy to learn. This will give me an insight into the usability of my weather system.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 5 - Easy to Learn  | <p>How did you find setting up the weather station?</p><p></p><p>Describe what you found easy/difficult during the set up of the weather station</p><p></p><p>Did you find the user instructions on the help page useful in the set up process of the weather station?</p><p></p><p>What did you find useful/not useful about the user instructions?</p> |

To ensure my user feedback is representative of the usability of my whole weather system, I will add a new empty database for each user so that they have experience setting up the weather station and collecting data over time. The instructions on how to use this software are shown on the help page. The app will notify the user they need to set up the weather station the first time they use the device. This is shown below.&#x20;

Once they set up the weather station, the user can start testing data and the different features of the app. Once they have tested the weather system, they will answer questions on a google form.

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

### User Feedback

In order to gain feedback on the usability of my weather station, a gave the device to a variety of people, both with and without experience in computer science, to test the set up process and use my weather system. I then asked them to fill out the form below with questions relating to usability and my sucess criteria
