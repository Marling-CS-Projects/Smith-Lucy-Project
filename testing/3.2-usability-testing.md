# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

Testing the usability of my weather station will allow me to understand how my solution is able to fit the needs of the stakeholder. To do this, I will test whether my solution is effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant, and easy to learn. This will give me an insight into the usability of my weather system.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

To ensure my user feedback is representative of the usability of my whole weather system, I will add a new empty database for each user so that they have experience setting up the weather station and collecting data over time. The instructions on how to use this software are shown on the help page. The app will notify the user they need to set up the weather station the first time they use the device. This is shown below.&#x20;

Once they set up the weather station, the user can start testing data and the different features of the app. Once they have tested the weather system, they will answer questions on a google form.

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

### User Feedback

In order to gain feedback on the usability of my weather station, a gave the device to a variety of people, both with and without experience in computer science, to test the set up process and use my weather system. I then asked them to fill out the form below with questions relating to usability and my sucess criteria

### Effective

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.19.33.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I found that all those who tested my system described my weather system as easy to use once the setup process was complete. This demonstrates that the user interface is effective and easy for the user to use, which is essential to the usability of my project.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.43.05.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of the main features of my project is the collection of weather data from the surrounding environment so that it can be displayed on the app, while requiring very little user input. I was pleased to see that all those who tested the device were able to receive two weather readings, either by waiting for the reading to upload or taking one manually.

### Efficient

#### Question 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.29.05.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is essential to the usability of the user interface of my project. Overall, all of the users described the app as easy to use, the majority describing it as "very easy" and the remaining 25% describing it as "fairly easy". The results showed me that all the users understood how to use the app. Furthermore, this showed the app was efficient in meeting the efficiency requirements of the user.

#### Question 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.29.54.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After asking whether any users had difficulty using the interface, the majority of users stated that they didn't find it difficult to use. I found it interesting that two of the users found the menu symbols difficult to interpret, and that it would be useful to have labels. Additionally, another person suggested that the user interface would be easier to use if some changes were made to the user instructions section of the user interface - including videos and images on the set up page to make it clear what the user has to do, and instructing the user to press the reset button first to manually take a reading rather than suggesting they wait between 20-45 minutes during the setup.

### Engaging

#### Question 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.23.26.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The accuracy of the data collected by the weather station is also crucial to the overall usability and function of my weather station. All the responses showed that they believed the data collected was fairly close to the current environment they were in, 62.5% strongly agreeing and 37.5% mostly agreeing. I was pleased with the outcome of this question as it showed the users were able to engage with the content of the weather app.

#### Question 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.30.24.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I found that all responses agreed that the data displayed on the graphs and weather predictions table were presented clearly. This is vital to the usability of my project as it ensures that the users are able to visually understand and engage with the weather app. Those who responded described the graphs as easy to read, and it was clear what the graphs and predictions represented.

#### Question 7

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.32.59.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The final question that tested whether my solution was engaging asked whether the user was able to understand and use the weather history page to look at previous weather recordings. As expected, all the users were able to use and understand this feature.

### Error Tolerant

#### Question 8

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.24.17.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another essential component of my user interface is that it is able to cope with missing data upon set up, and does not crash or run into any errors while being tested. I was pleased to see that none of the users had issues with the app.

#### Question 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.24.35.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Similarly to [question 8,](3.2-usability-testing.md#question-8) none of the responses suggested that there was an issue with the weather station itself crashing, or not collecting weather data.

#### Question 10

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.33.48.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is vital to the usability of my app as it gives the users an opportunity to describe any issues they had while using my app. I was pleased to see that the majority of users did not have any problems. However, two of the users stated that while they didn't have any errors, it took a long time to receive the results. One person found that it took multiple tries to connect with the weather station. This issue that the users experienced is likely due to a poor signal strength or Wifi connection.

### Easy to Learn

#### Question 11

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.25.01.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I found that the opinions on the ease of the setup process was split 50:50, half describing it as very easy and the rest describing it as fairly easy. This question is also essential to the usability of my project as it demonstrates how easy it is for an inexperienced user to learn how to use the weather monitoring and prediction system.

#### Question 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-03 at 14.34.21.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Overall, I have...
