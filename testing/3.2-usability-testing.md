# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

Testing the usability of my weather station will allow me to understand how my solution is able to fit the needs of the stakeholder. To do this, I will test whether my solution is effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant, and easy to learn. This will give me an insight into the usability of my weather system.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Once set up, did you find the weather system easy to use? Were you able to collect some weather data using the weather station? Did the user interface collect data at regular intervals?                                                                                                            |
| 2 - Efficient      | Were you able to navigate the app easily? Were you easily able to understand the data displayed on the user interface? If anything, what did you find difficult when using the user interface? Did you think the data displayed on graphs and tables for weather predictions were presented clearly? |
| 3 - Engaging       | Was the data collected correct and accurate? Why/why not? Did you find the app informative about current weather conditions, monitoring and predictions?                                                                                                                                             |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you have any issues or errors while using the system? If so, did the help page help resolve these issues?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | How did you find the setup process of the weather station? Did you find the help page useful in setting up and using the weather station? Was the weather system overall easy to use?                                                                                                                |

To ensure my user feedback is representative of the usability of my whole weather system, I will add a new empty database for each user so that they have experience setting up the weather station and collecting data over time. The instructions on how to use this software are shown on the help page. The app will notify the user they need to set up the weather station the first time they use the device. This is shown below.&#x20;

Once they set up the weather station, the user can start testing data and the different features of the app. Once they have testing the weather system, they will answer questions on a google form.

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

### User Feedback

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of my success criteria in 1.5 also relate to the usability of my solution. The usability tests for this criteria are outlined below.

| Criterion | Description                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
