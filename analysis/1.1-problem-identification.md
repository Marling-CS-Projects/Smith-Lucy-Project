# 1.1 Problem Identification

In the current climate, weather conditions including temperature, humidity and rainfall impact all people's daily lives. Weather influences human behaviour, especially when arranging activities and in decision making (Horanont et al., 2013). As well as improving the lives of the general public, forecasting vital in providing extreme weather warnings and making informed agricultural plans (Alley, Emanuel and Zhang, 2019). Since the recognition of patterns across seasons, weather systems have evolved, aided by technology, to provide accurate information based on changes in the atmosphere (Wiston and KM, 2018).

According to the Met Office (2023), global warming and climate change has resulted in extreme temperatures and weather conditions which are abnormal for the time of year. Recently, heatwaves, heavy rain, droughts and tropical storms have disrupted day-to-day activities. These sudden changes in weather have not only reduced the accuracy of weather systems, but also the public's confidence in prediction software applications (Scher and Messori, 2019). This has resulted in a decline in user satisfaction.

Additionally, the accuracy of weather forecasting and prediction is dependent on the user's location. According to AnbarcÄ± et al. (2008), there is an economic bias in weather forecasting, which prioritises high-density populations due to the extent of the market. This means that users living in countryside or agricultural areas will often receive inaccurate information. Thornes (2007) found that quality of weather forecasting in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden is dependent on user income and location. Therefore, further advancements must be made to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Around 89.29% of the world's population currently own a smartphone (Turner, 2023). Users are becoming dependent on these hand-held devices for basic information, including data from weather forecasting applications. However, current weather forecasting software have limitations involving climate and location that impact their satisfaction.

In this project, I will design a piece of software that monitors current weather conditions and makes predictions based on previous trends in a localised area. This will involve using sensors in the client's location to automate weather forcasting.
