# 1.1 Problem Identification

In the current climate, weather conditions including temperature, humidity and rainfall impact all people's daily lives. Weather influences human behaviour, especially when arranging tasks and  planning activities (Horanont et al., 2013). Forcasting is also vital in providing extreme weather warning and in agricultural planning (Alley, Emanuel and Zhang, 2019). Since the recognition of patterns across seasons, weather systems have evolved, aided by technology, to provide accurate information based on changes in the atmosphere (Wiston and KM, 2018).
