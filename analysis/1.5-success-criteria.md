| 1        | The device will need to collect data about weather conditions from the environment through sensors           | In order to display accurate data and make future predictions, I need to collect data from the environment                              |           |
| 2        | The weather station will need to transmit all data collected to the internet to be stored in a database      | Storing data in a database will allow data to be accessed by the app, and trends to be tracked over time.                               |           |
| 3        | Monitoring data - the data collected must be processed and displayed to represent current weather conditions |  I would like to monitor current conditions as part of my personal weather station                                                      |           |
| 4        | Forecasting data - the program must make predictions about future weather conditions                         | Forecasting is one of the most vital parts of my project. I want to make predictions about the weather and then display them on the app |           |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
