As shown in 1.1, the use of high quality and accuracy weather forcasting applications has become increasingly desirable based on climate change, increased weather warnings and the user's location. According to Fundel et al. (2019), the majority of customers make use of weather predictions for risk communication, informed decision making and marketing. A large vairety of industries, including construction, retail and sports, make use of weather analytics to plan for appointments, monitoring safety and for marketing (Foerster, 2019).  Weather forcasting information is also essential in the agriculture industry for crop production and animal farming in stratigic decision making (Calanca, 2014).&#x20;
