# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

As shown in 1.1, the use of high quality and accurate weather forecasting applications has become increasingly desirable based on climate change, increased weather warnings and the user's location. According to Fundel et al. (2019), the majority of customers make use of weather predictions for risk communication, informed decision making and marketing. A large variety of industries, including construction, retail and sports, make use of weather analytics to plan for appointments, monitoring safety and for marketing (Foerster, 2019). Weather forecasting information is also essential in the agriculture industry for crop production and animal farming in strategic decision making (Calanca, 2014).

To further my understanding of weather forecasting software, I am going to research the types of stakeholder, countries and locations, age ranges and how these different groups use application software.

In line with a stakeholder report from the Met Office, I have identifies five main types of stakeholder for weather forecasting applications (Clements et al., 2015). This includes the agriculture industry, buisnesses, and the general public.
