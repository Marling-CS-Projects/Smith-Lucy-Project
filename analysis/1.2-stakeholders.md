# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

As shown previously, around 89.29% of the world's population own a smartphone, resulting in a large market for applications. In 2022 there were around 0.73 billion downloads of weather apps such as Weather Channel and Clime, and is expected to rise to 1.06 billion by 2027 (Statista, 2023).

While Statista also suggests that weather apps are only the 23rd most popular category on the Apple App Store for the general public, forecasting software has become increasingly important in other industries such as agricultural farming. Weather forecasting information is also essential in the agriculture industry for crop production and animal farming in strategic decision making (Calanca, 2014). According to Fundel et al. (2019), the majority of customers make use of weather predictions for risk communication, informed decision making and marketing. A large variety of industries, including construction, retail and sports, make use of weather analytics to plan for appointments, monitoring safety and for marketing (Foerster, 2019).

From this research and information from the Met Office, I have identified three main stakeholders for weather application software (Clements et al., 2015). This includes the agriculture industry, businesses, and the general public.

## Demographics

The general public uses weather forecasting software for a variety of reasons, including choosing appropriate clothing and planning furture trips (Silver, 2014). Most users access these applications frequently for short-term predictions, the average U.S. adult using forecasts around 115 times per month (Lazo, Morss and Demuth, 2009). However, the issue of accuracy comes in to play when users depend on this data for making long term plans, therefore influencing which app they trust and use.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/demographics.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 2: The proportion of people categorised by gender and age who used weather applications regularly in Great Britain (Statista, 2013)</p></figcaption></figure>

Figure 2 shows that the is no major difference in weather applications between genders. I was surprised to see that more adults aged between 35 and 49 used applications more than people under 35, due to the accessibility and popularity of smart phones in young people. Meanwhile, only 32% of 50 to 65 year olds say they use weather applications regularly.&#x20;

According to Ruby (2023), iPhones are most popular in the 16-34 age group. It therefore stands to reason that they are a common stakeholder for weather applications. College students mainly use weather applications to gain insight into short-term information such as hourly forecasts (Phan et al., 2018).
