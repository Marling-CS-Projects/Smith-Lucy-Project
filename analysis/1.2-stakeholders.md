# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

As shown previously, around 89.29% of the world's population own a smartphone, resulting in a large market for applications. In 2022 there were around 0.73 billion downloads of weather apps such as Weather Channel and Clime, and is expected to rise to 1.06 billion by 2027 (Statista, 2023).

While Statista also suggests that weather apps are only the 23rd most popular category on the Apple App Store for the general public, forecasting software has become increasingly important in other industries such as agricultural farming. Weather forecasting information is also essential in the agriculture industry for crop production and animal farming in strategic decision making (Calanca, 2014). According to Fundel et al. (2019), the majority of customers make use of weather predictions for risk communication, informed decision making and marketing. A large variety of industries, including construction, retail and sports, make use of weather analytics to plan for appointments, monitoring safety and for marketing (Foerster, 2019).

From this research and information from the Met Office, I have identified three main stakeholders for weather application software (Clements et al., 2015). This includes the agriculture industry, businesses, and the general public.
