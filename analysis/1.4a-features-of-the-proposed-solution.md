# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Hardware

In this section I will first focus on the hardware required for this project. In order to collect data from the environment and monitor weather conditions, I must include sensors as part of my solution.

### Sensors

I will need a variety of sensors to take readings from the environment. According to Kodali and Mandal (2016), the basic data needed in IoT automated weather stations include temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity and and precipitation. I will also use an air quality sensor to measure the levels of polution on the air.

In order to collect data, these sensors will need to be conncected to a development board that is programed to take readings at regular intervals. It will then need to connect to the internet via WIFI or cellular services to upload data to the cloud.&#x20;

### Data collection

Having collected this data using sensors, I will now need to transmit it to the internet and save it to a database to be accessed by my application. For this I will use a development board, or a device that already has sensors contained within it. Below shows examples of designs for weather monitoring systems.

The reason why I am designing a weather station as part of my solution as it will allow me to acurately measure conditions using sensors from the stakeholders location. I can then use software to interact with this hardware in order to monitor and forecast weather.

## Software

Having looked at the hardware required for this project, I will now examine the software required to monitor and forecast weather, as well as an application to display this data.

### Monitoring

In order to display data on the app, I will need software to process the data from sensors. I will then need to store this data on a database so that it can be accessed overtime. This will allow me to track trends in weather conditions as well as current ones.

### Forecasting

The next aspect of my solution is forecasting. In order to predict future weather events, I will need to collect sufficient data. Weather forecasts typically require multiple readings from sensors in different locations to make a prediction. Therefore, I may need to use other readings (e.g. from weather APIs) as well as the data I have collected. According to Weber (2018), the best way to predict weather is measuring changes in atmospheric pressure, clouds, and wind. Having collected sufficient data, I will need to design an algorithm to accurately predict weather conditions within the local area.

### User interface

The final part of my solution is how I display current weather conditions and predictions. I will need to
