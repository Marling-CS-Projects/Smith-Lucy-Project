# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Hardware

In this section I will first focus on the hardware and sensors needed in the personal weather station in order to monitor the environment.

### Sensors

I will need a variety of sensors to take readings from the environment. According to \_\_\_, the basic sensors needed in wireless automated weather stations include:

* Thermometer
* Humidity
* Air quality monitor
*

### Data collection

Having collected this data using sensors, I will now need to transmit it to the cloud  and save it to a data base to be accessed by my application.



## Software

### Web/smartphone application

This section will focus on the basic requirements for the weather application.

### User interface

Now I will look into the aspects of the app's user interface.

### Monitoring

In order to monitor the surrounding environment of the user

### Forecasting

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
