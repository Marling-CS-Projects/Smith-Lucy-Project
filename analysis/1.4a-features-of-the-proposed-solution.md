# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Hardware

In this section I will first focus on the hardware required for this project. In order to collect data from the environment and monitor weather conditions, I must include sensors as part of my solution.

### Sensors

I will need a variety of sensors to take readings from the environment. According to Kodali and Mandal (2016), the basic data needed in IoT automated weather stations include temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity and and precipitation. I will also use an air quality sensor to measure the levels of polution on the air.

In order to collect data, these sensors will need to be conncected to a development board that is programed to take readings at regular intervals. It will then need to connect to the internet via WIFI or cellular services to upload data to the cloud.&#x20;

### Data collection

Having collected this data using sensors, I will now need to transmit it to the internet and save it to a database to be accessed by my application. For this I will use a development board, or a device that already has sensors contained within it. Below shows examples of designs for weather monitoring systems.

The reason why I am designing a weather station as part of my solution as it will allow me to acurately measure conditions using sensors from the stakeholders location. I can then use software to interact with this hardware in order to monitor and forecast weather.

## Software

### Web/smartphone application

This section will focus on the basic requirements for the weather application.

### User interface

Now I will look into the aspects of the app's user interface.

### Monitoring

In order to monitor the surrounding environment of the user

### Forecasting

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
