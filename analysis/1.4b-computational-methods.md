## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstration is the process where unnecessary features of a problem are removed in order to visulise a solution. By only including relevant parts of the problem, it will help simplify the programming problems and improve the efficiency of the overall solution.

Aspects of my project which I will use abstraction for include:

* When forecasting, I will need to design an algorithm to predict future weather conditions. To simplify this process, I will collect and use the minimal amount of data required to simplify the program on the weather station. This will also reduce the complexity of the weather prediction program. Implementing weather APIs and libraries will reduce the complexity of this problem further.
* The software used to obtain readings from sensors can be abstracted by using libraries. I will only need the weather station to transmit data to the internet not recieve data from it, which will simplify the program and improve overall efficiency.
* When designing a graphical user interface for my weather station, I will only include features needed by the stakeholder. This includes monitoring and forecasting data. By not including unecessary features such as radar maps, weather warnings and a complex design, I will reduce the programming required to build this app.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is vital to the future development of my project. This will involve considering the details required to complete my project, which is esspecially important when considering the combination of hardware and software in a personal weather station. Thinking ahead will allow me to visulise my final product, and the procsses requried to complete it.
