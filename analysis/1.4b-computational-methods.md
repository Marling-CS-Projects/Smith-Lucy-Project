# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstration is the process where unnecessary features of a problem are removed in order to visulise a solution. By only including relevant parts of the problem, it will help simplify the programming problems and improve the efficiency of the overall solution.

Aspects of my project which I will use abstraction for include:

* Forecasting - When designing a program to predict future weather conditions, I will only collect data that is most relevant to the problem. This will include trends in temperature, humidity&#x20;
*

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead involves considering future tasks and features of the project, giving me an indication of what my final outcome is going to look like.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
