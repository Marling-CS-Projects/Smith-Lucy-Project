This personal weather station is relevant to both the hardware and software side of the solution. The ECOWITT takes inputs from sensors and wirelessly transmits this data to the internet. This solution also includes a smartphone application that interacts with the weather station, allowing the user to regularlly monitor their home's conditions from any enviroment. While this solution does not include the weather forecasting aspect of the problem, it incoperates many features that are likely to be desirable to a stakeholder.

### Sensors and hardware

This section describes the features of the hardware that are used to monitor weather conditions.

### Overview

Weather is a basic forecasting application designed by Apple for iOS devices. Despite its limited functuality, it is convinient for basic weather conditions (including temperature, precipitation, humidity and visibility) and provides both hourly and 10-day forecasts for a wide range of locations. It also provides weather warnings from the UK Met Office, and notifications for nearby rain or snow.

### Usability

I found that the simplistic design made the application easy to navigate, accessible from your mobile device. As well as information for your current location, you can also switch between other locations for both short and long-term planning.
