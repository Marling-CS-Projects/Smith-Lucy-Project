## Personal Weather Station

### Overview

The ECOWITT WIFI weather station allows users to romotely track and monitor the weather conditions in their home. This personal weather station includes air quality, humidity and temperature sensors, which can be viewed from the smartphone application or digital screen.&#x20;

This personal weather station is relevant to both the hardware and software side of the solution. The ECOWITT takes inputs from sensors and wirelessly transmits this data to the internet. This solution also includes a smartphone application that interacts with the weather station, allowing the user to regularlly monitor their home's conditions from any enviroment. While this solution does not include the weather forecasting aspect of the problem, it incoperates many features that are likely to be desirable to a stakeholder.

### Sensors and hardware

This section describes the features of the hardware that are used to monitor weather conditions.

* The weather station includes 7 different sensors, including thermo-hygrometer, rain gauge, wind speed sensor, wind direction sensor, light and UV sensor and solar panel sensor. It also measures outdoor temperatures and humidity.
* Data collected from these sensors and graphs are then displayed on a basic digital console.

### App and usability

This section focuses on the ECOWITT Personal Weather Station's accompanying app and its usability.

The app displays similar data to the digital console. As well as optional indoor sensors, it displays the outdoor temperature and humidity. The user can monitor changes in temperature over time in the form of a graph. Based on the inputs from sensors, the app sends alerts to the user about extreme changes in weather (for instance, temperature, air quality, and rainfall).

The layout of the app is clear and simple to use. It is easy to scroll through weather information, look at previous trends in the form of graphs, and edit sensor preferences in settings. The app is convinient to monitor home weather conditions from any location, but could be improved visually by using bright colours.

| Digital Console             | The digital console would be an additional feature of this project which I would unlikely be able to complete in the time frame.

| Rain gauge and wind turbine | While these sensors increase the quality and accuracy of readings, I plan on using more basic sensors for my project. The hardware used in the ECOWITT weather station would increase the complexity of the project and would be difficult to complete in the time constraint. |
| Indoor sensors              | The indoor weather sensors are an additional feature of the project that I would likely not have time for add.                                                                                                                                                                 |

## The Channel Weather App

### Overview

The Weather Channel app is a weather forecasting web and smartphone application that is used to display both hourly and daily forecasts. It was developed by the weather channel television company and provides a detailed overview of conditions in your current location. Features include estimations of when rain is likely to end and probabilities of weather events. It also provides warnings for disruptions in your local area that are likely to disrupt day to day activities.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 15.33.22.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This solution focuses on the software and weather prediction side of the problem. The app displays information about a variety of locations, and provides hourly and daily predictions for up to 10 days. It has a radar map that shows changes in the atmosphere and precipitation. However, this solution doesn't involve the sensors and hardware.

### Monitoring and forecasting

In this section, I will examine the aspects of the weather forecasting data that are presented in the Weather Channel App.

* Home page - The home page on the smartphone app monitors current conditions, including temperature and precipitation predictions. It is then followed by simplified tabs representing all the other features. However, on the online app, all information is dispayed in blocks, side by side.
* Radar map - The weather radar map shows the changes in precipitation overtime on a map. While easy to navigate, it didn't provide any additional weather information.
* Hourly and daily forecast - The hourly forecast showed predictions for the next 24 hours, and the daily forecast went up to 10 days. This data was presented in a table, including the temperature, chance of precipitation, and windspeed/direction.
* Air quality - The air polution was a small section of the app, which monitored levels of ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. It shows the safety level of the air and sends notifications in cases of unsually high levels of polution.
* Weather prediction diagrams - Bar chart graphs are used to show the amount of rain or snow likely to come over time.
* Other features - humidity, dew point, pressure and UV index.

### Usability

In this section, I am discussing my experience using the application and its features.

The user interface for the app is basic and easy to navigate. All information is organised in blocks and you can tap on a tab to see more detailed information. You can easily switch between location by searching or selecting on a map. The homescreen is ordered based on the most recent updates, and includes weather warnings and notifications. The daily and hourly forecast is presented in a table format, which is easy to read through but may become overly complex on a smaller device. I found that the predictions from the app were mostly accurate.

The app has a different colour scheme depending on the time of day. The use of colours and backgrounds adds interest to the app, and help highlight certain features such as the 10 day forecast. It also included a "Health & Activities" section, which gave advice on whether conditions are suitable for runners, or a person with hay fever.

## Weather (Apple)

### Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 15.41.44.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Weather is a basic forecasting application designed by Apple for iOS devices. Despite its limited functuality, it is convinient for basic weather conditions (including temperature, precipitation, humidity and visibility) and provides both hourly and 10-day forecasts for a wide range of locations. It also provides weather warnings from the UK Met Office, and notifications for nearby rain or snow.

### Forecasting

This section examines the features of the Weather App.

* Hourly forecasts
* 10-day forecast
* Air polution
* UV index
* Rainfall predictions
* Wind
* Humidity
* Visibility

### Usability

I found that the simplistic design made the application easy to navigate, accessible from your mobile device. As well as information for your current location, you can also switch between other locations for both short and long-term planning.

The eye-catching design of the app is appitising to a stakeholder.&#x20;
