## Personal Weather Station

### Overview

The ECOWITT WIFI weather station allows users to romotely track and monitor the weather conditions in their home. This personal weather station includes air quality, humidity and temperature sensors, which can be viewed from the smartphone application or digital screen.&#x20;

This personal weather station is relevant to both the hardware and software side of the solution. The ECOWITT takes inputs from sensors and wirelessly transmits this data to the internet. This solution also includes a smartphone application that interacts with the weather station, allowing the user to regularlly monitor their home's conditions from any enviroment. While this solution does not include the weather forecasting aspect of the problem, it incoperates many features that are likely to be desirable to a stakeholder.

### Sensors and hardware

This section describes the features of the hardware that are used to monitor weather conditions.

* The weather station includes 7 different sensors, including thermo-hygrometer, rain gauge, wind speed sensor, wind direction sensor, light and UV sensor and solar panel sensor. It also measures outdoor temperatures and humidity.
* Data collected from these sensors and graphs are then displayed on a basic digital console.

### App and usability

This section focuses on the ECOWITT Personal Weather Station's accompanying app and its usability.

The app displays similar data to the digital console. As well as optional indoor sensors, it displays the outdoor temperature and humidity. The user can monitor changes in temperature over time in the form of a graph. Based on the inputs from sensors, the app sends alerts to the user about extreme changes in weather (for instance, temperature, air quality, and rainfall).

The layout of the app is clear and simple to use. It is easy to scroll through weather information, look at previous trends in the form of graphs, and edit sensor preferences in settings. The app is convinient to monitor home weather conditions from any location, but could be improved visually by using bright colours.

### Overview

The Weather Channel app is a basic and convinient forecasting application that is used to display both hourly and daily forecasts. It includes many features, such temperature, chance of percipitation, wind speed, humidity, UV index and air quality.

## Weather (apple)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 15.41.44.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Weather is a basic forecasting application designed by Apple for iOS devices. Despite its limited functuality, it is convinient for basic weather conditions (including temperature, precipitation, humidity and visibility) and provides both hourly and 10-day forecasts for a wide range of locations. It also provides weather warnings from the UK Met Office, and notifications for nearby rain or snow.

### Usability

I found that the simplistic design made the application easy to navigate, accessible from your mobile device. As well as information for your current location, you can also switch between other locations for both short and long-term planning.
