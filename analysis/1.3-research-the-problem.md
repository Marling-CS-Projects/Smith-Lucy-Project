This personal weather station is relevant to both the hardware and software side of the solution. The ECOWITT takes inputs from sensors and wirelessly transmits this data to the internet. This solution also includes a smartphone application that interacts with the weather station, allowing the user to regularly monitor their home's conditions from any environment. While this solution does not include the weather forecasting aspect of the problem, it incorporates many features that are likely to be desirable to a stakeholder.

### Sensors and hardware

This section describes the features of the hardware that are used to monitor weather conditions.

* The weather station includes 7 different sensors, including thermo-hygrometer, rain gauge, wind speed sensor, wind direction sensor, light and UV sensor and solar panel. It also measures outdoor temperatures and humidity.
* Data collected from these sensors and graphs are then displayed on a basic digital console.

### App and usability

This section focuses on the ECOWITT Personal Weather Station's accompanying app and its usability.

The app displays similar data to the digital console. As well as optional indoor sensors, it displays the outdoor temperature and humidity. The user can monitor changes in temperature over time in the form of a graph. Based on the inputs from sensors, the app sends alerts to the user about extreme changes in weather (for instance, temperature, air quality, and rainfall).&#x20;

These features make the ECOWITT Personal Weather Station desirable to many stakeholders. In the agricultural industry, users can set up the weather station on their land in multiple locations and monitor it from their handheld device. Alerts warning of changes in weather could allow them to protect or move crops, maximising their yield. Meanwhile, this feature would also be advantageous to members of the general public who wish to monitor their local environment.

The layout of the app is clear and simple to use. It is easy to scroll through weather information, look at previous trends in the form of graphs, and edit sensor preferences in settings. The app is convenient to monitor home weather conditions from any location, but could be improved visually by using bright colours. This would be usful to stakeholders both with and without experience in weather monitoring software.

<table><thead><tr><th width="208.5">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>The sensors used in the ECOWITT personal weather station, including temperature, humidity and air quality, are features that I would like to monitor. It also made me consider how to ensure sensors are waterproof and suitable for an outdoor environment. This would be useful to all stakeholders, including businesses, the agricultural industry and the general public as it would allow them to track their local environment.</td></tr><tr><td>Alerts</td><td>Alerts notifying the user about sudden changes in weather conditions (e.g. rain starting, or high temperatures) would be useful in informing the stakeholder and helping them make decisions. This is a valuable feature for stakeholders. For instance, it could be used in the agricultural industry to maximise crop yield or by businesses to predict their customer's shopping patterns.</td></tr><tr><td>Graphs</td><td>The graphs on the ECOWITT app are a clear visual way of monitoring past trends in weather. A stakeholder could use this to monitor their local environment.</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile or web app</td><td>I really like the way data collected by sensors is presented in the form of an app, convenient for a personal smartphone. This feature would be especially useful to the general public stakeholders, as it provides an easy and convenient way of monitoring their environment.</td></tr><tr><td>Temperature and humidity display</td><td>I found that the format of the accompanying application made it easy for the user to navigate. Information about temperature and humidity could help a stakeholder in making informed decisions.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% tab title="Features I won't include" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="207">Feature</th><th>Justification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Digital Console</td><td>The digital console would be an additional feature of this project which I would unlikely be able to complete in the time frame. An app online or on a mobile phone would be more convenient and allows more features needed by the stakeholder.</td></tr><tr><td>Rain gauge and wind turbine</td><td>While these sensors increase the quality and accuracy of readings, I plan on using more basic sensors for my project. The hardware used in the ECOWITT weather station would increase the complexity of the project and would be difficult to complete in the time constraints. The additional equipment required to measure rain and wind would be expensive and difficult to set up, which would not be ideal to many stakeholders.</td></tr><tr><td>Indoor sensors</td><td>The indoor weather sensors are an additional feature of the project that I would likely not have time to add. While a member of the general public may be interested to know how their indoor and outdoor environment compare, many stakeholders such as businesses and the agricultural industry would not find this useful as monitoring and predictions for the outdoor environment.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## The Channel Weather App

### Overview

The Weather Channel app is a weather forecasting web and smartphone application that is used to display both hourly and daily forecasts. It was developed by the weather channel television company and provides a detailed overview of conditions in your current location. Features include estimations of when rain is likely to end and probabilities of weather events. It also provides warnings for disruptions in your local area that are likely to disrupt day to day activities. This would be esspecially useful to stakeholders who are members of the general public.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 15.33.22.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This solution focuses on the software and weather prediction side of the problem. The app displays information about a variety of locations, and provides hourly and daily predictions for up to 10 days. It has a radar map that shows changes in the atmosphere and precipitation. However, this solution doesn't involve the sensors and hardware to collect personalised data. This means while a stakeholder would find it useful in decision making and planning, it would not necessarily be accurate or personalised to their environments.

### Monitoring and forecasting

In this section, I will examine the aspects of the weather forecasting data that are presented in the Weather Channel App.

* **Home page ->** The homepage on the smartphone app monitors current conditions, including temperature and precipitation predictions. It is then followed by simplified tabs representing all the other features. However, on the online app, all information is displayed in blocks, side by side.
* **Radar map ->** The weather radar map shows the changes in precipitation overtime on a map. While easy to navigate, it didn't provide any additional weather information.
* **Hourly and daily forecast ->** The hourly forecast showed predictions for the next 24 hours, and the daily forecast went up to 10 days. This data was presented in a table, including the temperature, chance of precipitation, and wind speed/direction.
* **Air quality ->** The air pollution was a small section of the app, which monitored levels of ozone, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. It shows the safety level of the air and sends notifications in cases of unusually high levels of pollution.
* **Weather prediction diagrams ->** Bar chart graphs are used to show the amount of rain or snow likely to come over time.
* **Other features ->** humidity, dew point, pressure and UV index.

### Usability

The user interface for the app is basic and easy to navigate. All information is organised in blocks and you can tap on a tab to see more detailed information. You can easily switch between locations by searching or selecting on a map. The home screen is ordered based on the most recent updates, and includes weather warnings and notifications. The daily and hourly forecast is presented in a table format, which is easy to read through but may become overly complex on a smaller device. I found that the predictions from the app were mostly accurate.

The app has a different colour scheme depending on the time of day. The use of colours and backgrounds adds interest to the app, and helps highlight certain features such as the 10 day forecast. It also included a "Health & Activities" section, which gave advice on whether conditions are suitable for runners, or a person with hay fever.

## Weather (Apple)

### Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 15.41.44.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Weather is a basic forecasting application designed by Apple for iOS devices. This would be difficult to a stakeholder as it would only be available to certain members of the public. The information on the app would not be detailed enough to provide certain stakeholders, such as business owners, a realistic insight into local weather. Despite its limited functionality, it is convenient for basic weather conditions (including temperature, precipitation, humidity and visibility) and provides both hourly and 10-day forecasts for a wide range of locations. It also provides weather warnings from the UK Met Office, and notifications for nearby rain or snow.

### Forecasting

This section examines the features of the Weather App.

* **Hourly forecasts ->** Predictions in weather help in making short-term decisions.
* **10-day forecast ->** Like many weather applications, this app provides forecasting information up to 10 days in advance.
* **Air pollution ->** Air pollution is measured on a scale of low to hazardous.
* **UV index ->** This measures the risk of a user's exposure to the sun.
* **Rainfall predictions ->** The app predicts the likelihood of precipitation using a percentage
* **Wind ->** The Weather App records wind direction and strength.
* **Humidity ->** This monitors the amount of water vapour in the air.
* **Visibility ->** The distance that can be seen. This provides useful information for decision making, e.g. deciding if it is safe to drive.

### Usability

I found that the simplistic design made the application easy to navigate, accessible from your mobile device. As well as information for your current location, you can also switch between other locations for both short and long-term planning.

The eye-catching design and layout to a stakeholder. You can easily switch between locations by swiping. The multi-location feature would be useful to members of the general public, as it would allow them to make decisions based on data from outside their local area. Furthermore, tracking the movement of weather may be useful to the agricultural industry.

### Features

<table><thead><tr><th width="222">Features</th><th></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Notifications</td><td>Useful notifications relating to changes in weather. This would be useful to stakeholders in warning them about future conditions, such as warning when it is going to rain to help keep dry.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10-day forecast</td><td>I really like how the app provides predictions in weather over the next 10 days, especially in an easy to read table format. This would make the app highly accessible and easily understandable to any stakeholder.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Predicting rainfall</td><td>A user would find this feature of a weather application useful because it gives them an idea of how likely it is going to rain. Predictions for precipitation would be useful to business owners, as it allows them to plan events and advertisements around the weather. It is useful to the agriculture industry in protecting crops and livestock.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Colourful design</td><td>The colourful layout makes the app easy to navigate and understand. This would be useful to any stakeholder, especially members of the general public where product engagement is vital to the success of the app.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Air quality</td><td>I want to include air quality monitoring within my project, as it would give the stakeholder an idea of the pollution levels in their environment.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% tab title="Features I will ignore" %}
<table><thead><tr><th width="176">Features</th><th></th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Precipitation map</td><td>While the precipitation map is an interesting feature of the Weather App, time restraints will not give me enough time to add this to the weather app. Also, since my weather station will focus on one location, it isn't as useful to show precipitation on a map to a stakeholder.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Complicated background design</td><td>I found the changing background design confusing, and it doesn't add much to the usability of the app. Instead, I will focus on other features that are more likely to be needed by a stakeholder.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>'Feels like' temperature</td><td>I like this feature of the weather app, but this would be difficult to estimate without collecting other data, such as wind and sunlight. This would be useful to stakeholders such as members of the general public as it takes into account other conditions, such as rain, wind and sunlight.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Multiple locations</td><td>I want to focus on monitoring weather conditions and making conditions in one location. While this would be an interesting feature, it wouldn't be particularly useful to many stakeholder.s Looking at multiple locations would be difficult in the time constraints. </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
