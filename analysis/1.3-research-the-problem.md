### Overview

Weather is a basic forecasting application designed by Apple for iOS devices. Despite its limited functuality, it is convinient for basic weather conditions (including temperature, precipitation, humidity and visibility) and provides both hourly and 10-day forecasts for a wide range of locations. It also provides weather warnings from the UK Met Office, and notifications for nearby rain or snow.

### Usability

I found that the simplistic design made the application easy to navigate, accessible from your mobile device. As well as information for your current location, you can also switch between other locations for both short and long-term planning.
