## Personal Weather Station

### Overview

The ECOWITT WIFI weather station allows users to romotely track and monitor the weather conditions in their home. This personal weather station includes air quality, humidity and temperature sensors, which can be viewed from the smartphone application or digital screen.&#x20;

This personal weather station is relevant to both the hardware and software side of the solution. The ECOWITT takes inputs from sensors and wirelessly transmits this data to the internet. This solution also includes a smartphone application that interacts with the weather station, allowing the user to regularlly monitor their home's conditions from any enviroment. While this solution does not include the weather forecasting aspect of the problem, it incoperates many features that are likely to be desirable to a stakeholder.

### Sensors and hardware

This section describes the features of the hardware that are used to monitor weather conditions.

### Overview

The Weather Channel app is a basic and convinient forecasting application that is used to display both hourly and daily forecasts. It includes many features, such temperature, chance of percipitation, wind speed, humidity, UV index and air quality.

## Weather (apple)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-13 at 15.41.44.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Weather is a basic forecasting application designed by Apple for iOS devices. Despite its limited functuality, it is convinient for basic weather conditions (including temperature, precipitation, humidity and visibility) and provides both hourly and 10-day forecasts for a wide range of locations. It also provides weather warnings from the UK Met Office, and notifications for nearby rain or snow.

### Usability

I found that the simplistic design made the application easy to navigate, accessible from your mobile device. As well as information for your current location, you can also switch between other locations for both short and long-term planning.
