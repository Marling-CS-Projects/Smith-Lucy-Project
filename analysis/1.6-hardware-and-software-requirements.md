# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements are the hardware and software components required to design and run a program. Within my own project, this will be hardware components that facillitate the program to monitor weather conditions and the device that the app will run on. I will use the IDE Visual Studio Code to develop and write my program and node.js as a runtime. Additionally, need to use a [web browser](1.6-hardware-and-software-requirements.md#user-requirements) to test the application.

| Software           | Hardware Required                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Visual Studio Code | <ul><li>1.6 GHz Processor</li><li>1 GB of RAM</li><li>Disk Space of 200 MB</li></ul> |
| Node.js            | <ul><li>4 vCPU Processor</li><li>2 GB of RAM</li><li>Disk Space of 25 GB</li></ul>   |

## Other Hardware Requirements

In this section, I will explore the hardware requirements of the personal weather station in order to design and produce a program. This will not include the physical components of the weather station itself, such as sensors.

As mentioned previously in [1.4a](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#data-collection), a development board will be needed to run the program. When chosing a development board, it will need to have a large enough storage capacity to run the data collection program, and acess to the internet so that weather conditions can be monitored wirelessly.&#x20;

The Particle Argon is a development board can connect wirelessly to the internet over WIFI. It requires code to be written in C++, which I must consider in the [development requirements](1.6-hardware-and-software-requirements.md#development-requirements) of my project.

## User Requirements

For the app to be easily accesed by a stakeholder, it will need to be available from their handheld device or PC. Therefore, the user will need to have a electronic device such as smartphone or laptop and acess to the internet for wirless weather monitoring. [According to StatCounter Global Stats (2023)](reference-list.md), the most popular web browsers are chrome (50.17%), safari (32.56%) and edge (8.37%). Below I have outlined the user requirements for the most popular web browsers.
