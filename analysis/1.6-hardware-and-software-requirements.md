# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements are the hardware and software components required to design and run a program. Within my own project, this will be hardware components that facillitate the program to monitor weather conditions and the device that the app will run on. Visual Studio code is an IDE that will allow me to... will use Visual Studio code... (Requirement of other IDE?)... Node.js/react.js... . I will also need to use a web browser to test the application.

## Other Hardware Requirements

In this section, I will explore the hardware requirements of the personal weather station in order to design and produce a program. This will not include the physical components of the weather station itself, such as sensors.

As mentioned previously in [1.4a](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#data-collection), a development board will be needed to run the program. When chosing a development board, it will need to have a large enough storage capacity to run the data collection program, and acess to the internet so that weather conditions can be monitored wirelessly.&#x20;

The Particle Argon development kit can connect wirelessly to the internet.&#x20;

(More details about the specific storage requirements of particle and languages)

## User Requirements

For the app to be easily accesed by a stakeholder, it will need to be available from their handheld device or PC. Therefore, the user will need to have a electronic device such as smartphone or laptop and acess to the internet for wirless weather monitoring. According to \_\_\_, 97.4% of UK households have access to the internet
