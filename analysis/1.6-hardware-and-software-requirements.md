# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements are the hardware and software components required to design and run a program.

| Software  | Hardware Required                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Package 1 | <ul><li>Proc</li><li>RAM</li><li>Disk Space</li></ul> |

## Hardware Requirements

In this section, I will explore the hardware requirements of the personal weather station in order to design and produce a program. This will not include the physical components of the weather station itself, such as sensors.

As mentioned previously in [1.4a](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#data-collection), a development board will be needed to run the program. When chosing a development board, it will need to have a large enough storage capacity to run the data collection program, and acess to the internet so that weather conditions can be monitored wirelessly. For instance, I could use a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or Particle Argon to run the weather monitoring program.

## User Requirements
