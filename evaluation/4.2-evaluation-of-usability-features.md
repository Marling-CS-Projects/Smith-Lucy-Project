## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                      | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | The personal weather station will need to automatically take readings from the environment at regular intervals  | Success          |
| 2           | It must then be able to communicate with the app wirelessly without input from the user                          | Success (mostly) |
| 3           | The user interface will then need to display weather monitoring and forecasting information visually             | Success          |

### Feature 1

My user feedback from 3.2 Usability Testing found that 100% of the users were able to take more than two weather readings, and all the readings taken were received at regular intervals (between 20-45 minutes). The weather station algorithm must be effective at taking weather readings to ensure that weather trends can be monitored and tracked over time, without error. It is important that this process requires minimal user input, as one of the main purposes of this system is to provide understandable weather information in one place. This system therefore succeeded at being efficient.

### Feature 2

This usability test for the wireless connection of the weather station was mostly successful, depending on the signal strength of the environment. To ensure my solution has a high usability, the weather station must connect in a range of outdoor and indoor environments. However, in areas where there is a signal strength, people testing the system found that taking manual readings took multiple attempts, and the readings could take up to five minutes to appear on the user interface.

### Feature 3

Another important aspect of usability is ensuring that graphs and tables on the user interface are effective in visually representing the weather monitoring and forecasting information for the weather station. From my user feedback, I found that people thought the graphs were presented clearly in a way they were able to understand.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                                 | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | It should be easy to set up the app and connect to the weather station                                                      | Success          |
| 2           | A stakeholder should be able to navigate through the app easily and understand all displayed data                           | Success (mostly) |
| 3           | All previous data readings should be uploaded to a database so that they can be easily accessed by the user at a later date | Success          |

### Feature 1

The setup of the weather station requires minimal input from a user. Once the weather station has been attached to a power source, the user can simply wait for the weather station to collect data and record it on a database, which can be used by the user interface. The system is therefore easy for the stakeholder to use, and they can quickly monitor their outdoor environment. Simplifying the process any user has to do ensures that the system is as quick and efficient as possible.

### Feature 2

The menu on the user interface is simple and easy to navigate. I used basic icons to represent the different pages on the app. Originally, I decided to use icons to minimise the complexity of the menu, making it easier to understand. However, some feedback I received suggested some people found it unclear what they represented, and would benefit from text describing the page or a description appearing when hovering on the icon.

### Feature 3

Without any user input, once data is collected by the weather station, it is automatically recorded on Mongo Database. The data can then be accessed by the user interface and displayed in a way the user understands. Additionally, during this process, a timestamp is added to the data. This allows information about when the readings were taken to be displayed on the user interface, providing the user with background information.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                 | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Design an app that is colourful and easy to navigate                                        | Success      |
| 2           | Present all weather data in the form of graphs and tables to grab the attention of the user | Success      |

### Feature 1

This feature is important as the visual layout of the app needs to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand to make the weather system engaging to a user. The user is also able to quickly access and navigate the app, as they can scroll down on the app to see more readings, view the weather history, and the user instruction page. I was pleased to see during [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging) people found the user interface had a clear layout and was easy to use.

### Feature 2

In [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#question-6), the feedback I received showed that the information on the user interface was easy to understand. It is vital to my project that graphs such as temperature trends and dust concentrations grab the user's attention, and make the system interesting and informative.

## Error Tolerant

<table><thead><tr><th width="251.33333333333331">Feature No.</th><th>Description</th><th>Success/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The app should be able to communicate with the weather station and database without error</td><td>Success</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Any anomalous or incorrect data should not be displayed on the weather app </td><td>Success</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Feature 1

This usability feature is based on dealing with the syntax errors and issues that could cause the weather system to stop or crash. Within the weather system, the repeating loop of reconnecting to the internet prevents network errors and the program runs correctly. Once the data is recorded on the database, the user interface is able to fetch the data. When a problem occurs, such as the back-end not running, missing weather predictions or when the program fails to call an API, the program is robust enough to catch the error, and instead notify the user using a toast to inform them of the issue and the appropriate next steps. This success was confirmed by [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), where none of the users reported an error.

### Feature 2

Meanwhile, the second error tolerance feature focuses on dealing with logical errors within the weather system, including validation and removal of data. Within the weather prediction program, all missing or invalid data is removed from the dataset before training a machine learning model. This prevents any issues with displaying weather predictions. Additionally, on the database python program, validation takes place to ensure all data displayed on the user interface is correct and accurate. Overall, this feature has been successful in my solution. A way of further improving usability and error tolerance would be to ensure the data transmission program works every time, as mentioned in [Effective, Feature 2](4.2-evaluation-of-usability-features.md#feature-2). This was an issue raised by one of the responses in [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), who found it took two tries to receive a reading.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                  | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Create a section that explains how to set up the weather station on the app                  | Success (mostly) |
| 2           | Include a tutorial explaining what the features of the app itself are and how to use them    | Success          |
| 3           | All other processes should take place automatically and therefore not require any user input | Success          |

### Feature 1

The user instructions usability feature is essential to the usability of all aspects of my weather system. More specifically, this feature refers to explaining how to set up the weather station. The text-based instructions on the user interface guide the user step by step through the process, explaining how to make sure the station is charged, connected to the internet, and placed in the ideal location. The user instructions then explain they have the option of pressing a button on the weather station to manually take a reading. While some users may find operating a button on the hardware confusing, this provides the flexibility to quickly take readings when setting up, instead of waiting the full 20-45 minutes. Although my feedback from [3.2 Usability Testing](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) showed users found the instructions helpful, several modifications were suggested to improve the ease of set up. Further developments include adding images, videos, and putting the weather station in user-friendly casing. However, by hiding the hardware the manual reading feature would be disabled.

### Feature 2

Another key feature of the user instructions is the 'How to use this app' section. This helps the user understand where to find current readings, graphs, weather predictions and view historical readings. This feature was a success and made the user interface easy for the stakeholder to learn.

### Feature 3

This final usability feature minimises any user input by programming extra background calculations and programs that are running in the background of the system. The back-end makes all weather predictions upon start-up, and the data is recollected every 30 seconds without requiring the user to refresh or restart the app. The python server connects to an MQTT broker and stores the weather data on Mongo Database. This means the user does not have to interact with either the weather station or the database while the program runs. This makes the whole system automatic and independent, making it easier for the stakeholder to use.
