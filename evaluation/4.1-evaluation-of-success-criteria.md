# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

In this section, I will evaluate how successful each of the Success Criteria outlined in [Section 1.5](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) are.

## Data Collection

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                  | When was it achieved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Criterion 1 - Achieved

This success criteria is essential to the collection of weather data from the local environment, allowing conditions to be stored on a database and monitored on the user interface. The weather station is able to automatically take readings of temperature, air pressure, humidity, altitude, dust concentration, sound, light and air quality. The weather station takes readings every 20-45 minutes, or the user is able to press a button on the hardware to take readings manually. While my solution did meet this success criteria, I could further develop the collection of weather data by improving the efficiency of the C++ program, and carry additional validation checks on the data collected to maintain a higher degree of accuracy.

The image below outlines the data collected by the weather station.

### Criterion 2 - Achieved

My solution was able to meet this criteria, as once the data is collected by the weather station it is quickly stored on a database for use by the app. During this process, the data is published to an MQTT broker, allowing a python server to subscribe to the topic and then record this data to Mongo Database. During this process, the data can be modified e.g. adding a timestamp. Communication between the weather station and the database could be improved by ensuring that the MQTT connection to the broker is consistent, and that no data is lost during the transmission. I also found that, depending on the strength of the Wifi signal, the length of time taken for the data to be stored on the database varies (anywhere from 10 seconds to 2 minutes). Therefore, to further develop my solution and improve this success criteria, I would adapt the program to make storage more consistent timings, and design a mechanism that checks the data has been received by the database to prevent missing readings.

### Criterion 3 - Acheived

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-12 at 09.40.27.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Main display on user interface</p></figcaption></figure>

The monitoring of current weather conditions was an essential aspect of my solution, as it allows the stakeholder to track current trends and understand their local environment. Current weather conditions including temperature, humidity and dust concentration are displayed clearly and visually on the user interface.  Furthermore, previous data trends can be viewed on graphs and charts. Overall, I was able to meet this success criteria as the user interface contains accurate, up to date data on weather conditions that provides a clear way of monitoring the environment.

### Criterion 4 - Partially achieved

This criteria was mostly achieved by my solution but could benefit from further developments. The weather prediction algorithm is able to produce 1-day predictions for minimum temperature and maximum temperature with a fairly high degree of accuracy, usually only a few degrees outside the actual temperature.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-15 at 10.12.05.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

However, time constraints meant I was unable to fully test and compare predictions to manually measured values, to check the accuracy of predictions on the actual solution. Additionally, I found that the accuracy of weather predictions decreased on forecasts for further days on the 14-day forecast. Additionally, I found that predictions for precipitation usually had an error of around 0.09 mm out, and the algorithm never predicted a day without rain, which is unrealistic in a real world environment. To further improve this criteria, I would use data collected by my weather station instead of APIs to make predictions, improve accuracy by providing more data such as daily and monthly averages to the machine learning model, and increase the variety of predictions available.

### Criterion 5 - Partially achieved

This success criteria was focused on the ability of the weather station to function in a variety of environmental conditions. In 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness, I found that overall, the weather station sensors and casing were robust enough to cope with extremely warm and cold environments, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. However, this was at a cost to some other hardware components, such as blocking the light from the light sensor and affecting the air quality inside the case. Additionally, how regular readings are received varies greatly between indoor and outdoor environments, due to the signal strength of the Wifi. To further improve this, I would adapt the data collection program to ensure that data is sent more regularly when signal strength is poor, to ensure data is still collected efficiently in all conditions.

### Criterion 6 - Achieved

I was able to achieve this criteria. Weather data was displayed visually on the user interface on the home page. The data displayed is clearly laid out and easily accessible to a user.

### Criterion 7 - Achieved

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-12 at 10.22.07.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Weather data stored on database</p></figcaption></figure>

This criteria was achieved well and it allowed the back-end to access weather data and display it on the user interface. The data is stored in a JSON format, including all the data collected by the weather station, a unique ObjectID and a timestamp. Mongo database is an effective way of storing my weather data both short and long-term, and the python server uploading data to the database is efficient and effective.

### Criterion 8 and 14 - Achieved

This success criteria is crucial to the overall functionality of the user interface, as it allows the user to visually understand the changes in conditions over time, rather than just looking at the numeric weather history. Trends over time are tracked using graphs such as the temperature one below. However, I could further develop this by allowing the user to customise their main display, allowing them to choose what data is on the graphs and the format of the graphs. For instance, the user could switch the temperature graph for humidity. An additional feature that I would develop is direct comparisons of trends over different time periods. To do this, I would design graphs showing multiple trends, such as temperature comparisons on different days, weeks and months. Overall, I was able to achieve this success criteria in my solution.

### Criterion 9 - Partially achieved

This criteria focuses on the efficiency of the approach to the weather predictions program. Currently, the weather predictions program works correctly and quickly, building a 14-day forecast using data by training a machine learning model, using a dataset containing weather at Heathrow Airport. The system uses the weather conditions from the previous day and weekly average temperatures to make predictions about temperature and precipitation.  However, this could be made much more accurate and efficient by using multiple days of weather conditions and modelling the algorithm from multiple data sources.&#x20;

### Criterion 10 - Achieved

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-12 at 10.43.10.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>User interface dashboard</p></figcaption></figure>

One of the main aspects of the homepage on the user interface is the main display (above). It gives the user a clear indication of their current weather conditions, including temperature and air quality. It also informs the user of when the last reading was taken. While I have fully met this success criteria, an opportunity for further development is making the user interface adapt to the user's requirements. To do this, I would use the current template as a default, and allow the different sections to act as widgets that can be rearranged to the user's needs. This relates to one of the comments in my usability testing.
