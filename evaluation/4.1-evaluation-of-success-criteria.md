# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

In this section, I will evaluate how successful each of the Success Criteria outlined in [Section 1.5](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) are.

## Data Collection

### Criterion 1

This success criteria is essential to the collection of weather data from the local environment, allowing conditions to be stored on a database and monitored on the user interface. The weather station is able to automatically take readings of temperature, air pressure, humidity, altitude, dust concentration, sound, light and air quality. The weather station takes readings every 20-45 minutes, or the user is able to press a button on the hardware to take readings manually. The image below outlines the data collected by the weather station.

### Criterion 2

Once the data is collected by the weather station, it is published to an MQTT broker. This allows a server to subscribe to the topic and then record this data to mongo database. This also allows me to run serveral validation checks on the data, including missing data values, and modify the data by adding a timestamp.&#x20;
