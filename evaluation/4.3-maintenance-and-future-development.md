# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Internet Connection Dependent ->** Currently, the functionality of the Weather System is limited by the Weather Station's signal strength and connection to Wifi. Without a stable connection, the device is unable to send data readings to an MQTT broker and the server cannot record data on the database. This limits the area range that the weather station can be used in.
* **Provides Data From the Localised Area Only ->** The weather system can only record data from a single  location, wherever the weather station is placed by the user. This means the user can't have different devices collecting data in different areas or comparing conditions. Additionally, all weather predictions are set to one area.
* **Accuracy and Variety of Weather Predictions ->** While the user interface displays data for minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation, the accuracy of these predictions is limited. It is unable to make predictions for other conditions, including snow, wind, air pressure and humidity. As well as using limited data to make 14-day predictions, the data currently being used is from weather APIs set to the location Cirencester. This means the predictions can't be personalised using data collected by the weather station and the location cannot be changed.
* **Delays Before Retreiving Weather Data ->**The current system for storing weather data on Mongo Database can be relatively slow, especially when the weather station is placed in a location with a poor internet connection. This can result in larger intervals between readings and less frequent updates on the user interface, limiting the accuracy of weather data.
* **Accessibility ->** The user interface on the app can be run on a browser or as a react app, assuming that the user meets the [Hardware and Software Requirements](../analysis/1.6-hardware-and-software-requirements.md).
